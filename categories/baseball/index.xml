      <description>&lt;p&gt;Those in baseball are well aware of the concept of platoon advantage: batters tend to have an advantage when facing pitchers of the opposite handedness. But knowledge of a platoon advantage may go beyond choice of relief pitchers on the mound to matchup with the upcoming lineup of power batters. It may inform, among other things, pitching strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Considering reasons behind the phenomenon, it may be explained by the greater relative variation in movement of the ball inside a batter’s &lt;strong&gt;plane of sight&lt;/strong&gt;, which I’ll define in a moment, while same-handed pitchers tend to keep the ball’s trajectory more aligned with that plane, making it harder to perceive lateral movement.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Dynamic, physics-informed systems in Bayesian models</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;By dynamic systems, I mean using differential equations to describe how data changes over time. Take running speed, for example. Several physics-based models of running speed have been developed, which I’ve previously discussed. The primary goal in those previous discussions involving sprint speed have been in estimating a maximum speed. But the underlying structure of these models estimate change in speed at time two from speed at time one: a differential equation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
