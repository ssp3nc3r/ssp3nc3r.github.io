I've taught graduate-level analytics at Columbia University since 2018 and developed comprehensive Stan curricula that have reached thousands of students worldwide through Athlyticz.

## Featured Courses

**Columbia University - Applied Analytics Program**

Since 2018, I've designed and taught courses in:

- *Storytelling with Data and AI* - Communicating complex statistical insights through narrative and visualization
- *Research Design* - Experimental design, causal inference, and statistical reasoning
- *Machine Learning* - Statistical learning methods and applications

I authored [*Data in Wonderland*](https://ssp3nc3r.github.io/diw/) as the textbook reader for the data storytelling curriculum.

**Athlyticz - Bayesian Modeling Courses**

I developed two comprehensive Stan courses with over 200 instructional videos that I produce, film, and edit myself:

- [*Becoming a Bayesian I*](https://athlyticz.com/stan-i) - Foundational Bayesian modeling and Stan programming
- [*Becoming a Bayesian II*](https://athlyticz.com/stan-ii) - Advanced topics including survival analysis, differential equations, physics-constrained models, and computational optimization

These masterclass-style courses with live coding have taught thousands of practitioners worldwide.
