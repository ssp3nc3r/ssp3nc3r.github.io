            <div class="post-content">
                <p>I provide consulting and advanced Bayesian modeling to organizations, including Premier League and Major League Baseball teams and teache in the <a href="https://sps.columbia.edu/faculty/scott-spencer" title="Columbia University, Faculty and Lecturer">applied analytics graduate program at Columbia University</a>, my alma mater. To make probabilistic programming in Stan and Bayesian data analysis more accessible, I develop and teach online courses too: e.g., <a href="https://athlyticz.com/stan-i">https://athlyticz.com/stan-i</a></p>
<p>Working with core developers of Stan and consulting, I build Bayesian, generative models of complex processes involving both human behavior and physical phenomena. My applied work focuses on modeling data for good and on professional sports.</p>
<p>Recent efforts are on the spatial and temporal impact of sea-level rise on the perceived value of coastal land, and estimating and forecasting player and team performance. My work in modeling and communication arise from a doctorate with honors in research and writing, master of science in sports management focused on data science analytics, and bachelor of science in chemical engineering focused on numerical methods and statistical process control.</p>
<p>My analyses have extended to other domains too. Previously, I analyzed data, communicated statistical insights through narrative, and static and interactive visuals, persuading various stakeholders of my technology clients on the impact of his analyses and designs for decisions related to process control, operations, and patents.</p>
<p>To assist visual communication, I have developed R packages, including one for mapping data values to visual encodings perceptually-uniform separately across hue, saturation, and luminance. The most persuasive communications are transparent and account for uncertainty, which are two areas of interest in my research and work in quantitative communication through visualization and storytelling. Along with research I have collaborated and published variously. These include analyses, editing, and research for <em>The Real Madrid Way</em> (BenBella Books 2016), of which Billy Beane (Executive Vice President of Baseball Operations at the Oakland A&rsquo;s) has said &ldquo;will be one of the most influential books on sports ever written.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Along with honors recognition for research and writing, my visualizations have been showcased and longlisted in the Kantar <em>Information is Beautiful</em> Awards, and my analyses won analytics competitions, including the Society for American Baseball Research&rsquo;s analytics competition, graduate division for my work involving human decision-making based on perception of spatial and temporal event information.</p>
<p>Preferred tools include Stan, R (incl. tidyverse, plus advanced visualization packages), Git, Quarto, SQL, C++, macOS, Davinci Resolve, and more. Where appropriate, I employ my own locally-hosted LLM, AI, and agentic CLI tooling to streamline workflow.</p>
