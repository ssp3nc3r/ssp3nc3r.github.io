<p>I develop sophisticated probabilistic models that transform complex data into strategic insights for elite sports organizations. My work integrates disparate data sources, physics-based constraints, and domain knowledge while properly accounting for uncertainty. I communicate complex mathematical concepts through bespoke visualizations and decision support tools that I design and build, bridging the gap between advanced statistics and executive decision-making.</p>
<h2 id="consulting">Consulting</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve consulted for organizations in Major League Baseball and the Premier League. Working with core developers of Stan, I develop generative models that reflect the actual data-generating processes in sports&mdash;combining physics, geometry, and human decision-making. Recent work includes architecting a player evaluation framework that jointly models over 80 leagues spanning a decade of match data.</p>
<p>What differentiates my approach: I model the physical constraints and human perception that govern performance, rather than relying on summary statistics that mask the underlying mechanisms. This physics-informed Bayesian approach produces more realistic predictions and clearer insights for decision-makers.</p>
<h2 id="teaching">Teaching</h2>
<p>I teach in the <a href="https://sps.columbia.edu/faculty/scott-spencer">applied analytics graduate program at Columbia University</a>, my alma mater, where I&rsquo;ve developed and led courses in storytelling with data, research design, and statistical communication. I authored <em>Data in Wonderland</em> as a <a href="https://ssp3nc3r.github.io/diw/">textbook reader</a> for Columbia&rsquo;s graduate program in data storytelling.</p>
<p>I also develop and teach advanced Stan courses for Athlyticz, an online learning platform: <a href="https://athlyticz.com/stan-i">Becoming a Bayesian I</a> and <a href="https://athlyticz.com/stan-ii">Becoming a Bayesian II</a>. These comprehensive Bayesian curricula include over 200 instructional videos that I produce, film, and edit myself at professional production quality in masterclass style with live coding, teaching thousands of students and practitioners worldwide. My workflow integrates modern AI tooling (locally-hosted LLMs, agentic CLI) with deep domain expertise, ensuring efficiency without compromising the bespoke analytical approach clients require.</p>
<p>My ability to communicate complex statistical concepts comes from dual backgrounds: a decade at Cadwalader and Jenner &amp; Block as an innovation and regulatory advocate, where I reviewed scientific and engineering ideas within legal constraints and communicated them persuasively to diverse stakeholders&mdash;from scientific experts to judges and business decision-makers&mdash;and over seven years teaching graduate-level analytics, where I refined how to make Bayesian modeling accessible.</p>
<h2 id="education--recognition">Education &amp; Recognition</h2>
<p><strong>Columbia University</strong> - Master of Science, Sports Management &amp; Analytics (4.0 GPA)
Winner, 2017 SABR Analytics Competition (graduate division)
Primary analyst and editor, <em>The Real Madrid Way</em> (BenBella Books 2016)</p>
<p><strong>University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign</strong> - Doctor of Jurisprudence
Honors in research and writing
Specialized in applying formal logic to complex legal and statistical questions</p>
<p><strong>Texas Tech University</strong> - Bachelor of Science, Chemical Engineering
Focused on numerical methods and stochastic process control</p>
<p>My work has been recognized in the Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards, and recent research includes the spatial and temporal impact of sea-level rise on coastal property values, and Bayesian approaches to estimating and forecasting player and team performance.</p>
<h2 id="stan-community">Stan Community</h2>
<p>I contribute software and documentation to the Stan probabilistic programming language as a scientific contributor and educator. I developed pedagogical implementations of McElreath&rsquo;s <em>Statistical Rethinking</em> that are widely used in academia, and mentor new users in Bayesian workflow. My Stan work combines open-source contribution with developing the teaching materials that have helped make Bayesian modeling more accessible to thousands worldwide.</p>
