      <description>In this post, I want to address why Bayesian modeling approaches, especially those implemented in Stan, should be considered as a valid alternative to common machine learning techniques in sports analytics. Specifically, I’ll focus on a well-established criterion for model evaluation: leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO-CV) and its use to calculate the expected log predictive density (ELPD). This scoring rule measures how well a model predicts unseen data. If you’d like a deeper explanation of ELPD and its interpretation in the context of this example, I’ll include one in an appendix at the end.</description>

      <title>Bayesian modeling recurring sports injuries</title>

      <description>Each sport carries with it specific types of injury risks. Pitching in baseball: UCL, rotator cuffs, and elbow injuries. Soccer: ACL tears, hamstrings, ankles. And so forth. Understanding the risks of injury is the first step in minimizing or preventing such injuries. In this post, I outline a Bayesian model for modeling these risks.
Let’s say we want to model \(K\) types of injury in a given sport, with the possibility of a player having multiple injuries over time.</description>

      <description>In the last post, I showed how we can speed up computation for splines in Stan. This post is, ahem, derivative. Perhaps we have noisy data of position and time, and we want to estimate speed and acceleration. We can use b-splines and their derivatives for this.
So let’s pick up where we left off, and add calculations in Stan to calculate the first and second derivatives of the spline in Stan.</description>

      <description>Milad Kharratzadeh provides a helpful case study on estimating splines in Stan. We can improve on his work with a few tricks to speed up the estimation process. Namely, if we decompose the spline matrix using QR decomposition, we speed up Stan’s fitting process by at least an order of magnitude.
Here’s how we can alter the code to accommodate splines with a few tricks to speed things up:</description>

      <description>Those in baseball are well aware of the concept of platoon advantage: batters tend to have an advantage when facing pitchers of the opposite handedness. But knowledge of a platoon advantage may go beyond choice of relief pitchers on the mound to matchup with the upcoming lineup of power batters. It may inform, among other things, pitching strategy.
Considering reasons behind the phenomenon, it may be explained by the greater relative variation in movement of the ball inside a batter’s plane of sight, which I’ll define in a moment, while same-handed pitchers tend to keep the ball’s trajectory more aligned with that plane, making it harder to perceive lateral movement.</description>

      <description>In an earlier post, I explained how to code custom distributions for use in modeling using the programming language Stan. Expanding upon that post, here, I’ll demonstrate how we code a function to generate random values from those distributions.
One direct approach just involves a bit of algebra. As in the earlier post, I’ll again use the three-parameter Weibull distribution. Generally, in the first step, we can set the CDF of the distribution equal to a random value from, say, a uniform distribution \(u \in [0, 1]\), like so:</description>

      <description>The probabilistic programming language called Stan is a powerful tools for modeling. It includes numerous distribution functions we can use to model. While it cannot include every conceivable distribution in its available functions, it does enable the next best thing: we can code our own!
The Stan library does not, for example, currently include the three-parameter Weibull distribution. In this tutorial, I’ll code its PDF and CDF to demonstrate coding custom distributions in Stan.</description>

      <description>With interactive communications, we frequently encourage the graphic to provide some form of overview, and use interactions for adding details on demand. For these details, tables provide a flexible way to organize the information. And we can link the view of such tables to user actions like a pointer hover event where the table of details is in a tooltip. In this tutorial, we construct an html table for our tooltip so that we can organize lots of details on demand.</description>

      <description>In cycling, (Allen 2019) has been an influential instruction for training and racing with a power meter. The authors discuss training load in the context of a few functions: one they call a training stress score, the other two acute and chronic training load, respectively. Training stress score is an estimate of the amount of work going into a single workout while acute and chronic training loads are estimates of the short and medium term accumulated loads from training.</description>

      <description>In R’s grammar of graphics package (ggplot2), we can encode data in custom-made glyph shapes from vector graphics and encode its size, fill color, or both. SVG graphics display lines, colors fills using paths. Let’s make an SVG graphic containing a single path of a complex shape, assign the graphic in R to data, and change its attributes. For this exercise, I’ve created an SVG path of the silhouette of a baseball player (using Inkscape)1.</description>

      <description>ssSankeyGrad returns a ggplot object encoding the flow between beginning and ending categorical data, i.e., a sankey diagram, wherein each flow is encoded as a color gradient. Those color gradients transition between a user-specified color for each category. The parameters are constructed such that c1, c2, col1, col2, and values are all vectors of the same length and corresponding positions represent one flow between categories. The categories c1, c2 are vectors of type character string, col1, col2 are vectors of type character string and include either named colors or hexidecimal representations of color, and values are of an integer or numeric type that encode the amount of “flow” between each category.</description>

      <description>We dread an empty ticket booth. The Dodgers’ average game attendance, for example, can be below capacity — they have seats to fill, despite having winning seasons.
To draw more fans, consider the words of famed economist Simon Rotternberg, who said “uncertainty of outcome is necessary for consumers to pay admission to ball games.” While winning is important, it’s the not knowing that creates excitement. Have the Dodgers maximized winning with uncertainty of outcome?</description>

      <description>By dynamic systems, I mean using differential equations to describe how data changes over time. Take running speed, for example. Several physics-based models of running speed have been developed, which I’ve previously discussed. The primary goal in those previous discussions involving sprint speed have been in estimating a maximum speed. But the underlying structure of these models estimate change in speed at time two from speed at time one: a differential equation.</description>

      <description>Prefontaine “finally got it through my head that the real purpose of running isn’t to win a race. It’s to test the limits of the human heart. And that he did. Nobody did it more often. Nobody did it better.”
— Bill Bowerman.
We’ve been recording progress towards those limits, whatever they are, for some time. World records have been collected for running distances, from 50 meters on an indoor track to marathons and beyond.</description>

      <description>Responding to the global effects of climate change — whether by mitigation or adaptation — requires that we, as humans, collectively change how we live. In many ways, how we live is governed by what policies we, or whomever made those policies, decided. Perhaps an effective way in some societies to enact change for the common good is, sadly, for those in power — e.g., those wealthy — to internalize future effects.</description>

      <description>Let’s practice expressing a probabilistic model aided by physics. Physics have been used, of course, to mathematically describe the forces involved in running short distances. To estimate sprint speed we can inform our models with basic anatomical information and physics. The mathematical physics of running speed depend on body weight, and stride length and rate. Let’s begin with those.
Let’s start with physics equations to describe speed, and accelerating to maximum speed.</description>

      <description>Traditional machine learning of sports performance often overlooks the physical constraints of the game, making models prone to identifying patterns driven by selection bias rather than actual game dynamics. Machine learning models may overfit to confounding variables, generating predictions that are not generalizable or realistic without grounding predictions in the known physics and geometry of sports, including baseball.
Physics, geometry, and trigonometry govern all movement in sports performance, like baseball&amp;mdash;from the ball&amp;rsquo;s trajectories off the mound or in the outfield to player positioning, rounding bases, throws, and ball contact with bats, dirt, and grass.</description>

      <description>Teams score — or don’t — event by event. Events change the state of the game. Solo home runs aside, whether a score results from any event depends upon prior events: a batter’s double only “drives in a score” when an earlier batter made it on base. By the collection of events a player generates, or more accurately, by the change in expected runs to which they contribute, we can measure players offensive values.</description>

I’ve made my recoded examples available here if you get stuck or want to compare methods of coding.</description>

      <description>Here is our description of our presentation at Saberseminar 2018: “A common definition of sabermetrics is the application of statistics to baseball. However, despite clear progress over the past few decades, we argue that sabermetrics has largely ignored the most important statistical principle to baseball: generative modeling. In this talk we discuss several conceptual errors with sabermetrics that preclude optimal decision making. Each of these problems can be overcome using a principled Bayesian approach to inference, which we demonstrate using the Stan statistical software.</description>

      <description>From logistic regression to a neural net Fitting a logistic regression in R Basic Neural network Forward propogation Back propogation Training the network Our neural network Bibliography From logistic regression to a neural net With all the terminology and perhaps unfamiliar looking plots designed to resemble the inner workings of a brain, neural networks may seem confusing. So let’s bypass all the jargon and such for a few minutes. A basic neural network can be thought of as just chaining together regressions that use a nonlinear function to transform \(\boldsymbol{X}\).</description>

      <description>Through the eyes of writer Roger Kahn, we’ve witnessed major league pitchers working to fool batters for ages. Regarding one Brooklyn Dodgers pitcher,
“Dazzy Vance in his prime had a different trick,” [Kahn’s] father said. “For seven years he was the best strikeout pitcher in the league. Vance wore a long undershirt and he took a scissors and cut slits in the right sleeve. It ran clear down to the wrist.</description>

      <description>I lecture in the applied analytics graduate program at Columbia University, my alma mater. To make probabilistic programming in Stan and Bayesian data analysis more accessible, I develop and teaches online courses too: e.g., https://athlyticz.com/stan-i
Working with core developers of Stan and consulting, I build Bayesian, generative models of complex processes involving both human behavior and physical phenomena. My applied work focuses on modeling data for good and on professional sports.</description>
