<hr />
<p>In these analyzed data, described below, Trout demonstrated slightly higher expected footspeed and slightly shorter expected times to first base than did Altuve; although their performance is close and we expect a near toss up, given the data used, as to who comes out ahead on any given play.</p>
<p>The conditions analyzed include use of 2016 regular season data on both players’ field coordinates when running. I subset these data in a few ways after deriving speed at each time measurement provided. Firstly, any speeds calculated to be greater than world record pace was discarded as unreliable due to measurement error. Also discarded were some data with missing <code>sv_pitch_id</code>. Secondly and as generally known, because runners do not always need maximum effort when running, the analysis attempted to single out circumstances where maximum effort was most likely.</p>
<p>Specifically, the analysis focused on runs where the batter made it near second base (whether or not they actually earned a double) or significantly passed first base along the foul line. Doing so makes it likely that the batter attempted maximum effort from crack of the bat through first base. Other scenarios were not studied as these data would be less likely to distinguish maximum effort from other efforts. The details and code for my analysis follow.</p>

<p>Runner coordinates show deviations from baserunning paths, which may arise in various contexts. One includes runners overshooting first base along the foul line in attempts to outrun a throw to first base. Another is consistent with runners leaving the field after an out (either by the runner or otherwise an out ending the half-inning). In such circumstances it may be difficult to know exactly when the runner is attempting max effort.</p>

<p>Differences in speed distributions between the players as shown here are subtle. We can also see that for both players, their speed changes over time within a given run. These plots suggest that Trout — at least in the circumstances reviewed — accelerates a bit more consistency (the lines showing initial accelleration are more concentrated and slightly steeper) and better holds his speed (his histogram shows more instances gathered at higher speeds).</p>
<p>Let’s go into more detail, keeping in mind that more likely estimates of max effort for <em>part of the run</em> may be found where batters — along with overshooting first base — have attempted to advance at least to second base. Unless due to a ground rule double or a home run, we may assume that max effort was likely at least to the penultimate base advanced. Max effort was likely at least through, say, first base when the batter ran at least near second base. Let’s study those scenarios, specifically including the reaction time from hitting to running since this scenario would seem to have the most impact on wins.</p>

<h2>Conclusions and Next Steps</h2>
<p>Let’s keep in mind several things with this analysis. First, we can expect significant variation as to who may be quicker — or generate a higher max speed — on any given play. This should be understandable as the model does not account for the many conditions that could affect their runs. We can conduct a similar analysis, folding into the above models additional variables from, say, MLBAM’s PITCHf/x system, which gives us outcome information on each play: did two outs exist, in which case we can expect the runner to provide max effort? Did a field create an error such that the runner, after slowing down, sped back up with new efforts? Last, this analysis suggests that should these two players ever toe the line — side-by-side — we’d see a great race!</p>
