      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve completed pre-production on my second, advanced course &amp;mdash; &lt;em&gt;Becoming a Bayesian II&lt;/em&gt; &amp;mdash; which I intend to launch soon. As I move into production of the video material, I though it would be helpful to reflect on and share my approach last time, which resulted in launching &lt;em&gt;Becoming a Bayesian I.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To produce the previous course &lt;em&gt;Becoming a Bayesian I&lt;/em&gt;, I generally followed the production workflow described below, which includes pre-production, production, and post-production. By pre-production, I&amp;rsquo;m referring to development of course script, code, and visuals. Production refers to recording the content onto video. And post-production refers to editing content.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
