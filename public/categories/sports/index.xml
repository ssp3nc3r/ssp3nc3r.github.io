      <title>Bayesian modeling recurring sports injuries</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Each sport carries with it specific types of injury risks. Pitching in baseball: UCL, rotator cuffs, and elbow injuries. Soccer: ACL tears, hamstrings, ankles. And so forth. Understanding the risks of injury is the first step in minimizing or preventing such injuries. In this post, I outline a Bayesian model for modeling these risks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let’s say we want to model &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(K\)&lt;/span&gt; types of injury in a given sport, with the possibility of a player having multiple injuries over time. Each athlete may experience multiple injuries and each injury corresponds to one of the &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(K\)&lt;/span&gt; types. If over the time in question, no injury occurs, we can call that “censored”.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Traditional machine learning&lt;/strong&gt; of sports performance often overlooks the physical constraints of the game, making models prone to identifying patterns driven by selection bias rather than actual game dynamics. Machine learning models may overfit to confounding variables, generating predictions that are not generalizable or realistic without grounding predictions in the known physics and geometry of sports, including baseball.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Physics, geometry, and trigonometry&lt;/strong&gt; govern &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;all movement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; in sports performance, like baseball&amp;mdash;from the ball&amp;rsquo;s trajectories off the mound or in the outfield to player positioning, rounding bases, throws, and ball contact with bats, dirt, and grass. Players, coaches, and managers make decisions based on these physical realities. Ignoring them in data models risks producing outputs that don&amp;rsquo;t align with how the game is actually played.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
