      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve completed pre-production on my second, advanced course &amp;mdash; Becoming a Bayesian II &amp;mdash; which I intend to launch soon. As I move into production of the video material, I though it would be helpful to reflect on and share my approach last time, which resulted in launching Becoming a Bayesian I.
To produce the previous course Becoming a Bayesian I, I generally followed the production workflow described below, which includes pre-production, production, and post-production.</description>

      <description>Hey everyone! I’m excited to announce my new online course for learning direct Stan coding for Bayesian analysis. Available now; enroll here: https://athlyticz.com/stan-i.
— TL;DR —
Actual Stan coding, not a high-level interface At-your-own-pace videos: shows live coding while explaining Hosted RStudio session to practice alongside me Starts with fundamentals, builds to hierarchical models Emphasizes a Bayesian workflow Modeling applied to sports data My goal is to make learning Stan as easy and fast as possible.</description>
