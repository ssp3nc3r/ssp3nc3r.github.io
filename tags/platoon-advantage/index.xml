      <description>Those in baseball are well aware of the concept of platoon advantage: batters tend to have an advantage when facing pitchers of the opposite handedness. But knowledge of a platoon advantage may go beyond choice of relief pitchers on the mound to matchup with the upcoming lineup of power batters. It may inform, among other things, pitching strategy.
Considering reasons behind the phenomenon, it may be explained by the greater relative variation in movement of the ball inside a batter’s plane of sight, which I’ll define in a moment, while same-handed pitchers tend to keep the ball’s trajectory more aligned with that plane, making it harder to perceive lateral movement.</description>
